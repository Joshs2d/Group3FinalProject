                <p>
                Our team is dedicating our time and effort to creating a better way for users to keep track of the ingredients inside their fridge.
                By using our program, users are able to insert ingredients that are put into their fridge, and understand what meals are available for
                cooking based on each ingredients availability and expiration date.
                </p>

                <p>
                For the future we will integrate with grocery store retailers, to make the process even simpler of adding those ingredients from a QR
                code printed onto the reciept, making the process of inserting each ingredient much easier. 
                </p>

                <p>
                The current pages allow for users to update their fridge, showing all the different ingredients they have, also a list of recipes they can find based
                on the different ingredients that they hold. A little information about our page and team, and then even a blog for others to talk about their
                Fridge-O-Matic experience. Finally they have the ability to sign in to their own special account that contains their own personal fridge.
